1.- Program gets installed on computer
2.- If the PC restarts, roach will run in the background and will look for new usb drives
3.- The syware will be activated after a reboot. Now (after a restart) every time any USB-Drive is installed in the affected PC, the program will copy itself into it, and will create a hidden folder called data with the payload.exe in it

The actual payload is stored int the data folder. If someone opens the ClickMe.exe it will copy itself and the payload into the APPDATA and will add both programs to the startup menu
